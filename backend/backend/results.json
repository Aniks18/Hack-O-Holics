      "snippet": "The landslides that killed hundreds of people in Kerala's Wayanad earlier this month were triggered by a burst of rainfall that was made about 10 per cent heavier by human-caused climate change, the latest analysis by a team of leading scientists has found. Researchers from India, Sweden, the US and the UK warned that such events will become more common as the climate continues to warm. The study by World Weather Attribution (WWA), an academic collaboration that studies the impact of climate change on extreme meteorological events such as heat waves, droughts, and storms, highlights the need for rigorous assessments of landslide risk and improved early warning in hillside regions of northern Kerala to prevent repeat landslide disasters. WWA scientists analysed climate models with high enough resolution to accurately reflect rainfall in the relatively small study area, according to a press statement. These models indicated that the intensity of rainfall has increased by 10 per cent due to climate change, the group of scientists concluded.",
